	"heroText": "To realize the sustainability potential of biogas solutions, there need to be sufficiently good societal conditions and strategies among public organizations. Biogas solutions involve several sectors, many actors, and depend on various types of infrastructure. This also makes them particularly sensitive to policy changes and makes them dependent on long-term strategies. New knowledge is needed to better understand the necessary societal conditions and which strategies are most effective.",

	"research": "No societies or states have fully realized the potential of biogas solutions, which indicates that it is a difficult challenge. In Europe, most biogas plants are in Germany where the policy initially emphasized and supported the production of renewable electricity. Crops were the main substrate. Nowadays, Germany and the whole of Europe are moving towards the Nordic model for biogas which instead is based on waste and by-products as substrate and upgrading to biomethane which is primarily used for transport or is fed into the gas network where it is often used in industry. Municipalities and regions have long been key players in developing biogas solutions because they have sometimes managed to integrate different policy areas and identified the overall benefit of biogas solutions. Many of them have been driving strategic work for a long time that is based on collaboration and goal formulations. At the national level, there are examples of countries that have introduced long-term economic conditions for biogas production. In addition to Germany, this applies to Denmark and the Czech Republic where the production of biogas has increased rapidly. In Sweden, there has been a tax exemption for biogas for a long time and the opportunity for investment support. Since 2022, it has been supplemented with support linked to methane reduction, upgrading to biomethane, and making the gas liquid. The EU wants to increase the production of biomethane quickly and has set a goal of 350 TWh per year by 2030. Member countries will need to develop their own strategies that involve local and regional actors as well as companies to together achieve this goal.",
	"phdCourseDescription": "Research training is conducted within the Biogas Solutions Research Center. The purpose of the course is to provide broad knowledge about the development of biogas solutions, from process technology and biochemical processes to biogas from a system perspective, societal effects, and conditions for implementation."
